Step 1: Set up a basic Node.js backend

Create a simple Express server with user authentication
Set up CRUD operations for notes
Implement proper TLS/SSL for secure connections
Deploy locally and expose with ngrok for testing

Step 2: Create the Android client

Set up a basic notes app UI
Implement Retrofit for API communication
Configure proper SSL/TLS handling
Add SSL pinning to prevent MITM attacks

Step 3: Enhance security features

Implement token-based authentication
Add different security configurations for debug vs release
Configure network security config for cleartext traffic rules
Handle certificate validation properly

mkdir certificates
cd certificates

# Generate a private key
openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048

# Generate a certificate signing request
openssl req -new -key private-key.pem -out csr.pem

# Generate a self-signed certificate (valid for 365 days)
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in csr.pem -signkey private-key.pem -out certificate.pem
